## Project Description
**SalesVision** is built using machine learning techniques to predict future sales from past sales data. The dataset includes training and testing data, which the model uses to make accurate sales predictions.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training using algorithms such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees
- Performance evaluation with metrics like RMSE, MAE
- Visual representation of predictions vs. actual sales

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for building the predictive model
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualization and plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and model building

## Installation Instructions
To run **SalesVision** locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aadhityan-Senthil/SalesVision.git
   cd SalesVision
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Ensure the data files are in place:
   - **ProductSalesTrainingData.csv**
   - **ProductSalesTestingData.csv**

## Usage
Once set up, run the script to train and predict sales:

```bash
python SalesModel.py
```

Alternatively, if you're using a Jupyter Notebook, open the provided notebook files to interactively work through the data and model training.

### Example

```python
# Load the training data
import pandas as pd
training_data = pd.read_csv('data/ProductSalesTrainingData.csv')

# Train a Linear Regression model
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/ProductSalesTestingData.csv')
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```
