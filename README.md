## 📝 **Project Description**
SalesVision is built using machine learning techniques to predict future sales from past sales data. The dataset includes both training and testing data, which the model uses to generate accurate sales predictions.

### **Key Features:**
- **Data preprocessing** and **feature engineering**
- **Model training** using algorithms such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees
- **Performance evaluation** with metrics like RMSE, MAE
- **Visual representation** of predictions vs. actual sales

## 🛠️ **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Programming language for building the predictive model
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For visualization and plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For exploratory data analysis and model building

## ⚙️ **Installation Instructions**
To run SalesVision locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aadhityan-Senthil/SalesVision.git
   cd SalesVision
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Ensure the data files are in place**:
   - `ProductSalesTrainingData.csv`
   - `ProductSalesTestingData.csv`

## 🚀 **Usage**
Once set up, run the script to train and predict sales:

```bash
python SalesModel.py
```

Alternatively, if you're using a **Jupyter Notebook**, open the provided notebook files to interactively work through the data and model training.

### **Example:**

```python
# Load the training data
import pandas as pd
training_data = pd.read_csv('data/ProductSalesTrainingData.csv')

# Train a Linear Regression model
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
test_data = pd.read_csv('data/ProductSalesTestingData.csv')
predictions = model.predict(test_data)
```
